# Clima
A WIP no bells and whistles weather app with a simple and minimalistic design based on Desire Creative Agency's <a href=https://dribbble.com/shots/20675054-Mobile-Weather-app>beautiful design</a>. In it's current state, the app is a proof of concept, not intended for daily use. An API key is provided inside for easy, no setup testing.

# To-do
- Allow for input of own API key
- Implement modular color picking
- Implement forecast card element screen
- Pull down to refresh

# Suggestions
Do you have suggestions? Create an issue and I'll get to them soon!
